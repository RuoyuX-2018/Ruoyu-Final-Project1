# Scanpath Prediction Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning

This project is developed from the code: https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/Scanpath_Prediction

plot_matrics.py: plot FTP, Scanpath Ratio, Multimatch and probability mismatch.

plot_result.py: plot the predicted scanpath by IRL, predicted scanpath by Naive Dpeth and Scanpath Depth, and scanpath of ground truth. 

dcb_vusual.py: visualize the belief map to understand the state representation.

generate_RGBD.py: generate the training input of Naive Depth and Scanpath Depth.
